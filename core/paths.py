"""The reference paths.

Deterministic, no RNG -- like everything else in this sandbox, the same choice
always gives the same curve.

A path is a plain dict of dense polyline arrays:

    pts      (N, 2)  world xy of each sample
    tangent  (N, 2)  unit tangent at each sample, pointing along travel
    s        (N,)    cumulative arc length, s[0] = 0
    length   float   total arc length
    name     str     what the UI shows

Samples are uniformly spaced in arc length (~1 cm), which is what lets the
sim's nearest-point search use a fixed index window (sim.py, SEARCH_W).

TWO RULES every path must obey, because the car's spawn pose is fixed:
  1. start at the origin,
  2. with the tangent pointing along +x.
The car spawns at (0, 0, 0.03) with the identity quaternion, so a path obeying
both starts the episode with zero cross-track AND zero heading error. A path
that broke either rule would begin with a step disturbance, which would mix an
initial transient into every tracking metric.

Every curve here is built from three segment primitives -- LINE, ARC and
CORNER -- so the tangents are analytic, including at the joins between
segments, where a numerical gradient would smear across the curvature reversal
and quietly corrupt e_ct at exactly the hardest instant.

  line(length)          straight, curvature 0
  arc(radius, sweep)    constant curvature 1/radius; sweep > 0 turns LEFT
  corner(angle)         a very tight arc (0.15 m) -- see corner() for why it is
                        a fillet rather than a true tangent discontinuity

    WHY THIS IS A FILLET AND NOT A ZERO-RADIUS CORNER. A true corner was built
    first and is a dead end, for a reason worth keeping:

      At a tangent discontinuity the car overshoots straight past the apex.
      The nearest path point STAYS at the apex, so the whole offset is
      along-track and `e_ct` -- which is measured perpendicular to the
      reference tangent -- reads EXACTLY ZERO while the car is a metre off the
      path. The steering PID therefore sees no error at all, applies no
      correction, and drives straight off the map at every gain setting. Not a
      tuning failure: a blind spot in the error definition, which a lookahead
      or a pure-pursuit reference would not have.

    So a corner here is a 0.15 m fillet -- half the car's length, five times
    tighter than anything else in the catalogue, and still tight enough that
    tracking it well is genuinely hard -- but with a defined tangent all the
